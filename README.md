The purpose of this application is to assess the strength of the password inputted in the application page. The app gives you an instant update on your result. The feedback from this helps to improve the strength of the userâ€™s password. The purpose of this app is to help stop the bad habit of poorly planned passwords. Since there is no official scale or formula to weigh the absolute strength or weakness of a code. The application takes your password and checks the length of the password and if it contains symbol, alphabets, numbers and spaces. The strength is determined by this. This is simply a guide to making a good password. It consists of a home page, application page, key index page and an about page. The home page leads you to the application page. The application page houses the main app. Here you get to type in your code and check how secure it is by clicking on the check button. The next page is called the key index page. The key index page shows all the colours and what they symbolise. Finally, the about page. The about page explains how the app works and drops some hints on security.
